# ZMK firmware for the Nine keyboard

This repo contains firmware for the [Nine keyboard](https://github.com/bsag/nine-nano). If you want to use my version of the keymap, you can go to the Actions tab, find the most recent workflow with a green checkmark and download the firmware zip file. See the Nine keyboard build guide for [instructions on how to flash the firmware](https://github.com/bsag/nine-nano/blob/main/docs/build_guide.md#flashing-firmware). 

The `main` branch contains the firmware for the keyboard and Nice!View screens. If you don't want the screens, the `no-screens` branch is the one for you.

If you would like to modify the keymap, you can fork this repository.
